## Abstract

The following standard adapts [ERC-4626](./eip-4626.md) to support multiple assets or entry points for the same share token.

It adds a new `share` method to allow the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) dependency to be externalized.

This also enables Vaults which don't have a true share token but rather convert between two arbitrary external tokens.

It also adds an operator permission schema, that enables more complex Vault integrations.

Lastly, it enforces [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) support for Vaults.

## Motivation

One missing use case that is not supported by [ERC-4626](./eip-4626.md) is Vaults which have multiple assets or entry points such as liquidity provider (LP) Tokens. These are generally unwieldy or non-compliant due to the requirement of ERC-4626 to itself be an [ERC-20](./eip-20.md).

## Specification

### Definitions:

The existing definitions from [ERC-4626](./eip-4626.md) apply.

- Multi-Asset Vaults: A Vault which has multiple assets/entry points
- Pipe: A converter from one token to another (unidirectional or bidirectional)
- Operator: An account that has unlimited permissions on all methods for another account.

### Methods

#### share

The address of the underlying `share` received on deposit into the Vault. MUST return an address of an [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) share representation of the Vault.

`share` MAY return the address of the Vault itself.

If the `share` returns an external token i.e. `share != address(this)`:
* entry functions MUST increase the `share` balance of the `receiver` by the `shares` amount. i.e. `share.balanceOf(receiver) += shares`
* exit functions MUST decrease the `share` balance of the `owner` by the `shares` amount. i.e. `share.balanceOf(owner) -= shares`

MUST _NOT_ revert.

```yaml
- name: share
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs: []
  outputs:
    - name: shareTokenAddress
      type: address
```

#### `isOperator`

Returns `true` if the `operator` is approved as an operator for an `owner`.

```yaml
- name: isOperator
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: owner
      type: address
    - name: operator
      type: address

  outputs:
    - name: status
      type: bool
```

#### `setOperator`

Grants or revokes permissions for `operator` to manage Requests on behalf of the `msg.sender`.

MUST set the operator status to the `approved` value.

MUST log the `OperatorSet` event.

MUST return True.

```yaml
- name: setOperator
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
    - name: operator
      type: address
    - name: approved
      type: bool

  outputs:
    - name: success
      type: bool
```

### Events

#### `OperatorSet`

The `owner` has set the `approved` status to an `operator`.

MUST be logged when the operator status is set.

MAY be logged when the operator status is set to the same status it was before the current call.

```yaml
- name: OperatorSet
  type: event

  inputs:
    - name: owner
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: operator
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: approved
      indexed: false
      type: bool
```

### Multi-Asset Vaults

Multi-Asset Vaults share a single `share` token with multiple entry points denominated in different `asset` tokens.

Multi-Asset Vaults MUST implement the `share` method on each entry point. The entry points SHOULD NOT be [ERC-20](./eip-20.md).

### Pipes

Pipes convert between a single `asset` and `share` which are both [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens outside the Vault.

A Pipe MAY be either unidirectional or bidirectional.

A unidirectional Pipe SHOULD implement only the entry function(s) `deposit` and/or `mint`.

### [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) support

Smart contracts implementing [ERC-7575](./eip-7575.md) MUST implement the [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) `supportsInterface` function.

It MUST return the constant value `true` if `0x2f0a18c5` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument.

### Share-to-Vault lookup

The [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) implementation of `share` SHOULD implement a `vault` method, that returns the address of the Vault for a specific `asset`.

```yaml
- name: vault
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs: 
    - name: asset
      type: address
    
  outputs:
    - name: vault
      type: address
```


## Rationale

This standard is intentionally flexible to support both existing [ERC-4626](./eip-4626.md) Vaults easily by the introduction of a single new method, but also flexible to support new use cases by allowing separate share tokens.

### Ability to externalize [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) Dependency
By allowing `share != address(this)`, the Vault can have an external contract managing the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) functionality of the Share. In the case of Multi-Asset, this avoids the confusion that might arise if each Vault itself were required to be an [ERC-20](./eip-20.md), which could confuse integrators and front-ends.

This approach also enables the creation of new types of Vaults, such as Pipes, which facilitate the conversion between two external [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens. These Pipes could be unidirectional (i.e. only for assets to shares via deposit/mint, or shares to assets via redeem/withdraw) or bidirectional for both entry and exit flows.

### Including Share-to-Vault lookup optionally

The `vault` method is included to look up a Vault for a `share` by its `asset`. This enables integrations to easily query Multi-Asset Vaults.

This is optional, to maintain backward compatibility with use cases where the `share` is an existing deployed contract.


## Backwards Compatibility

Existing [ERC-4626](./eip-4626.md) Vaults can be made compatible with [ERC-7575](./eip-7575.md) by adding a single `share` method that returns the address of the Vault.

## Reference Implementation

```solidity
    // This code snippet is incomplete pseudocode used for example only and is no way intended to be used in production or guaranteed to be secure

    contract TokenizedVault {
        address public immutable share = address(this);
        
        mapping(address owner => mapping(address operator => bool)) public isOperator;
        
        function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) external returns (uint256 shares) {
            require(owner == msg.sender || isOperator[owner][msg.sender]);

            // ...
        }

        function setOperator(address operator, bool approved) public returns (bool) {
            isOperator[msg.sender][operator] = approved;
            emit OperatorSet(msg.sender, operator, approved);
            return true;
        }
    }

```
## Security Considerations

[ERC-20](./eip-20.md) non-compliant Vaults must take care with supporting a redeem flow where `owner` is not `msg.sender`, since the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) approval flow does not by itself work if the Vault and share are separate contracts. It can work by setting up the Vault as a Trusted Forwarder of the share token, using [ERC-2771](./eip-2771.md).
